# [USACO](usaco.org) on a Chromebook with [REPL.it](repl.it)
If you haven't already, make an account & log in on both of the above websites.

### On [usaco.org](usaco.org):
* Enter the current USACO contest (starts your 4-5hr time limit - be prepared!), or go to a past contest
* Choose a challenge from the 3-4 assigned options (or one of the Bronze challenges in a past contest)
* Note the specified input & output filenames & formats
* Brainstorm your solution (paper is your friend!)

### On [repl.it](repl.it):
* Click "New Repl", and choose your desired language (Python3, Java, C++)
* Copy in the skeleton code for your language of choice from this repository
* Click [Add New File] to enter project mode, and name it the specified input filename for the challenge you're attempting

OR
* Fork one of my skeleton REPLs from [here](https://repl.it/@benbroce3)
* Rename FILENAME.in to the specified input filename for your the challenge you're attempting

Then
* Copy & Paste the exact example input text from the problem into the input file
* Change the FILENAME statements in the skeleton to the correct input & output filenames
* Write your code (the fun part!)
* Run to see if the generated output file is correct
* Download your complete solution
    * Go to the main code tab & click [Download File] in the lower-left corner
    * Rename to something you can remember with the .py extension locally

### On [usaco.org](usaco.org):
* Upload your code, & select your language
* Double-check your code if you don't get a 10/10 & have time

### Repeat for each challenge as you have time. Good luck!
