# USACO Practice Solutions
Solutions to past USACO algorithmic coding challenges. For more information about USACO & how to participate in the actual competition, see the [resources] directory & [the USACO website](usaco.org).

### To contribute:
1. Verify that your code receives a perfect [10/10] score on [USACO's analysis mode](usaco.org) (check in with us on slack if you're having trouble)
2. Try to document your code & methods as well as possible (within reason), so that others can understand your approach
3. In the first line of your source code, place a comment with a link to the USACO problem it solves in square brackets
   * Python Ex: `#Solves [http://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=567]`
  
4. Add & Commit to the master branch your single source file with the filename format:
   * `YYYY-MM_level_challengeName_nameTag.extension`
   * Ex: `2015-12_bronze_fencePainting_benbroce3.py`

### Please don't submit solutions to competitions until after they are over
### (Wait 1-2 days after the last contest day to be safe)
### Please don't modify others' files without their permission.
### Report any formatting errors, suggestions, or inappropriate use as an issue.
